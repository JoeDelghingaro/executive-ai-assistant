  Joe has a few rules for how he likes his emails to be written:

  - He generally likes to match their tone. If they write formally, then so will he. If they write casually, then he should write casual
  - If working with an assistant to schedule, then he is usually more formal
  - If conversing with someone he seems to know well, then he is more direct and to the fact
  - Joe is very factual driven and tries to be as accurate as possible

triage_no: |
  - Automated emails from services that are spamming Joe
  - Ignore emails from Infocon Systems that say EDI 850 in the subject line
  - Cold outreach from vendors - this happens a lot as people try to sell Joe things. He is not interested in these
  - Emails where they are asking questions that can best be answered by other people on the thread. \
  Joe is often on a lot of threads with people from his company (Whitmor) but often times he does not need to chime in. \
  The exception to this is if Joe is the main driver of the conversation. \
  You can usually tell this by whether Joe was the one who sent the last email
  - Generally do not need to see emails from Stripe
  - Notifications of comments on Google Docs
  - Automated calendar invitations
triage_notify: |
  - Google docs that were shared with Joe (do NOT notify him on comments, just net new ones)
  - Docusign things that needs to sign. These are using from Docusign and start with "Complete with Docusign". \
  Note: if the Docusign is already signed, you do NOT need to notify Joe. The way to tell is that those emails start \
  with "Completed: Complete with Docusign". Note the "Completed". Do not notify Joe if "Completed", only if still needs to be completed.
  - Anything that is pretty technically detailed about LangChain. Joe sometimes gets asked questions about LangChain, \
  while he may not always respond to those he likes getting notified about them
  - Emails where there is a clear action item from Joe based on a previous conversation, like adding people to a slack channel
triage_email: |
  - Emails from clients that explicitly ask Joe a question
  - Emails from clients where someone else has scheduled a meeting for Joe, and Joe has not already chimed in to express his excitement
  - Emails from clients or potential customers where Joe is the main driver of the conversation
  - Emails from other Whitmor team members that explicitly ask Joe a question
  - Emails where Joe has gotten added to a thread with a customer and he hasn't yet said hello
  - Emails where Joe is introducing two people to each other. He often does this for founders who have asked for an introduction to a VC. If it seems like a founder is sending Joe a deck to forward to other people, he should respond. If Joe has already introduced the two parties, he should not respond unless they explicitly ask him a question.
  - Email from clients where they are trying to set up a time to meet
  - Any direct emails from Whitmor's owners (Sandy Felsenthal, Scott Felsenthal)
  - Any direct emails from Whitmor's CFO (Rob Cerato)
  - Any direct emails related to an EDI error 
  - Emails where it seems like Joe has a pre-existing relationship with the sender. If they mention meeting him from before or they have done an event with him before, Joe should probably respond. If it seems like they are referencing an event or a conversation they had before, Joe should probably respond. 
  - Emails from friends - even these don't ask an explicit question, if it seems like something a good friend would respond to, Joe should do so.

  Reminder - automated calendar invites do NOT count as real emails
